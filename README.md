this is a MVP airbnb for co-working space. It is my final fullstack project for Wyncode Academy. The puropse was to demonstrate the use of ruby on rails to solve a real world problem with a platform that allows host users to make money on their space and allows guest users to save time, money and energy by accessing close by workspaces, it also affords guests greater comfort and unique experiences big-box brick and morter can't provide.

At this time, the app allows a host to list a work space. Routing to the listings and guest booking need work and a payment option has not been integrated yet; we did this in a week.

This repo is here to demonstrate my new-found skill set. If/when I decide to take the concept to market, I will start over again with the user having separate entity relationships to guest and host.

To get it going, all you have to do is start the rails server rails s while you are in the root folder.

Call byebug anywhere in the code to stop execution and get a debugger console

for a demo of the app, go to wyncode facebook live Oct. 19th Pitch Day I am at the 1:15 mark. I changed the name form zenpark to escher.

Check the app out at (https://zenpark.herokuapp.com/)

To run the app locally, run 'rails s' in the command line (rails required).
